Game Logs from Major League Baseball from 1950 - 2014

Description:
The data here includes game information for Major League Baseball games from 1950 through 2014.  This includes 126,513 observations,
and 76 variables.  Python scripts were used to pull the data from retrosheet and then add in the era and starting hof variables.  Hall of Fame
pitchers were pulled from wikipedia and cross reference with the list here: http://www.retrosheet.org/retroID.htm  I used excel and a vlookup
formula to create the Hall Of Fame csv file.

code was also added to properly calculate the number of innings played.

                                        the second inning, ten in the seventh and didn't bat in the
