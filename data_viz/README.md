# Make Effective Data Visualization - Final Project
## Summary
>This data visualization shows the growing trend in Major League Baseball to use more and more pitchers in a game.  This trend over time has dramatically increased the length of games in baseball.  I want to walk the reader through the growing trend year by year, but then open up the viz for the reader to explore and verify for themselves.
